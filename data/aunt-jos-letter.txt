Hello darling!
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I, your dear Aunt Josephine, am dead!
I'm leaving you the Ebiten apartment. I had grand dreams of building a real estate empire; perhaps you'll be more successful than I was.
The building is ... charming. Alright, it does have a few issues, but nothing you can't handle! And don't be afraid to try fixing things yourself.
Well anyway, good luck, and don't be too sad that I'm gone.
All my love,
Aunt Jo
