Hello, my dear,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I, your dear Aunt Josephine, am dead!
I'm leaving you the Ebiten apartment. I had grand dreams of building a real estate empire, but that didn't pan out. Nevertheless, the property is ... charming, and the tenants have been good. It does have a few issues, but what building doesn't? You'll figure it out, and don't be afraid to improvise and fix things yourself. Oh, and don't forget to take vacations! I left the Hamptons house to my own Mariela, so you'll have to find your own spot.
Well, that's all dear! Don't be too sad that I'm gone. Good luck!
All my love,
Aunt Jo
PS: I've left some supplies in building storage, should anything happen to break.
