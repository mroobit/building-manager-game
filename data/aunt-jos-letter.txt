Hello, my dear,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I, your dear Aunt Josephine, am dead!
I'm leaving you the Ebiten apartment. I had grand dreams of building a real estate empire; perhaps you'll be more successful than I was.
The property is ... charming. It does have a few issues, but what building doesn't? I'm sure you'll be able to fix most things that come up yourself.
Well, good luck! Don't be too sad that I'm gone.
All my love,
Aunt Jo
